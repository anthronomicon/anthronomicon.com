Anthronomicon is a portmanteau of the Greek _Anthropos_ (human) and the _nomicon_ suffix popularized by the fictional work of H.P. Lovecraft's [Necronomicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necronomicon) and Neal Stephenson's [Cyrptonomicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptonomicon). This website is a project by [Tyler Reckart](https://tylers.world/), constructed as an outlet to explore history, culture, and what makes us human.
